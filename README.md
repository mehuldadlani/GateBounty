# üí° What we solve

GateBounty is a platform that DAOs can use to incentivize their loyal members by providing them with exclusive opportunities. This provides them with a better community and helps them make their submissions quality-based rather than quantity-based.

- The data is stored on Polybase database, and NFT token gating is also done with it.
- We also have easy onboarding methods for Web2 users.
- We believe in providing this opportunity to all users, irrespective of their knowledge in Web3.

# Features

- Our platform leverages a cutting-edge Particle Network Authentication System, providing a seamless and secure onboarding process.
- The platform offers a robust bounty system powered by token gating using Polybase.
- To ensure the quality and trustworthiness of submissions within the DAO bounty platform, we implement a robust verification system.
